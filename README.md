# Simple-Language-Model-Implementation
This repository contains a Jupyter notebook (llmipynb.ipynb) that demonstrates a simple, character-level language model built with PyTorch. The model is a basic Transformer-based architecture, similar to a simplified GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer).

The notebook walks through the entire process of building and training the model, from data preparation to text generation.

Features
• Character-level tokenization: The model works directly with characters, not words or sub-words.

• Self-attention mechanism: Implements a multi-head self-attention layer to process sequences.

• Feed-forward networks: Includes a simple feed-forward layer in each Transformer block.

• Training loop: A basic training loop to minimize cross-entropy loss.

• Text generation: The trained model can be used to generate new text based on a given prompt.

How to Use
1. Open the Jupyter notebook:
Open the llmipynb.ipynb file in a Jupyter environment (like JupyterLab or Google Colab).

2. Run the cells:
Execute each cell in the notebook sequentially. The notebook will:

• Download a text file (wizard_of_oz.txt) to train the model.

• Set up the vocabulary and data loaders.

• Initialize and train the GPTLanguageModel.

• Generate new text based on a prompt.

Dependencies
The code requires the following Python libraries. You can install them using pip:

• pip install torch

The notebook itself also relies on wget which is typically available in Linux/macOS environments and Google Colab.

Notebook Structure
The llmipynb.ipynb notebook is organized into several key sections:

• Dependencies and Hyperparameters: Imports necessary libraries and defines global variables for the model's architecture and training.

• Data Loading and Tokenization: Loads the training text, creates a character-level vocabulary, and defines encoding/decoding functions.

• Model Architecture: Defines the core components of the Transformer model, including Head, MultiHeadAttention, FeedFoward, and the main GPTLanguageModel class.

• Training and Evaluation: Contains the training loop and a function to estimate the model's loss.

• Text Generation: Demonstrates how to use the trained model to generate new text.
